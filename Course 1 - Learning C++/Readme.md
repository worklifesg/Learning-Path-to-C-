<h3 align='center'> Course 1 - Learning C++ </h3>

C++ is an efficient and versatile programming language. C++ powers systems software, desktop applications, and even video games, and it's the language that helped land humans on the moon. Simply put, C++ is a must-know for any modern-day programmerâ€”and it's a great place to get started if you're programming for the first time. This course will get you up and running fast. This course covers **simple data types, including numbers and strings; flow-control features like loops and if, else, and switch statements; and functions, the code that encapsulates tasks your program performs**. It also covers working with files and special data structures such as classes and linked lists.
