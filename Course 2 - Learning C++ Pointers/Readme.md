<h3 align='center'> Course 2 - Learning C++ Pointers </h3>

Pointers are a type of variable that holds a memory address as its value. They are used to control memory allocation in resource-constrained applications. Pointers are surprisingly simple and incredibly valuable to developers who want to create smart, memory-efficient programs. Learn how pointers differ from addresses and arrays, and how they are used to allocate memory both at program execution and as the program runs. Find out how to pass pointers as arguments to functions, and use the new and delete operators to assign memory dynamically.
