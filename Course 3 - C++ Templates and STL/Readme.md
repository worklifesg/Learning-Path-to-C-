<h3 align='center'>  Course 3 - C++ Templates and STL </h3>

C++ templates support generic programming, code that works independent of type. The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is one of the most complete and powerful container libraries available. Having a solid grasp of both C++ templates and the STL is essential for programmers looking to attain competency in C++.
